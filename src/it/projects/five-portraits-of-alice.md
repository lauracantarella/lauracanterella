Fabrizio wrote about Five Portraits of Alice: "My personal Wonderland has always occupied a large portion of my life, both in childhood and adulthood. There is no doubt that it was a way, as perhaps it still is, of protecting myself from the real world, which can at times be brutal and indifferent.(…) Wonderland is a fantasy, as is the story that each of us creates of ourselves. Between the imaginary and reality, this story becomes our story, one which is full of incoherence and pitfalls, but at the same time it is still the place where the facts of life find their meaning and where dreams take shape, which become ideas and maybe even projects that come true.
