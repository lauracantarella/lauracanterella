In an advanced prospecting of today¹s territory, HiperCatalunya seeks to import tomorrow's potentials to interrogate the territory to bring out its capacities and latencies. Beyond the traditional mechanisms of territorial analysis, this group endeavour attempts to identify and express a multidisciplinary approach to our environment, encouraging interpretations open to potential interaction between the existing and the imaginable, in accordance with an innovative dimension of contemporary culture tending of foster new spaces for new ways of life, but also new logics and new aesthetics for new escenarios of progress.
