These photographs by Laura Cantarella lend themselves to a curious ambiguity: presented in a super-panoramic format, they deploy themselves before us like a vast register of extended horizons, diverse, changing, varied. However, when we hold the edges of the picture in our fingers and bend it until they meet, we discover an unexpected 360-degree diorama that reveals the true format of the image: that of a circular view as the translation of a polyfocal, multiple gaze attentive to the recognition of an nth-dimensional reality. In effect, Cantarella's photographs bend space and time in a single image.” – Manuel Gausa
